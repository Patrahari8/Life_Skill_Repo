# Learning Process

## Question 1
### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
The Feynman Technique improves learning by identifying weak areas for development and simplifying concepts through instruction.

## Question 2
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
the notion that 20 hours of deliberate, focused practice can make a big difference in your ability to master a new talent. With this method, picking up new talents feels easier and more doable.

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
When learning and solving problems, the brain processes information in two separate ways, which are referred to as active and diffused modes of thinking:

- **Active (Focused) Mode**:
   This type of thinking is very intentional and focused, with your attention narrowly focused on a single task or problem.
- **Diffused Mode**:
   This type of thinking is more relaxed and open, allowing your thoughts to stray and link different ideas more broadly.

## Question 4
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
The steps to take when approaching a new topic are:
- **Deconstruct the skill**: Break the skill into smaller parts to focus on what's essential.
- **Learn enough to self-correct**: Study just enough to practice and make adjustments as needed.
- **Remove barriers to practice**: Eliminate distractions to create a conducive environment for learning.
- **Practice for at least 20 hours**: Commit to practicing for 20 hours to overcome the initial frustration and see progress.

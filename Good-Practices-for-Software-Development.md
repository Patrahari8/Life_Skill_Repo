# Good Practices for Software Development
## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?
- **Gathering requirements:** Always take detailed notes during team discussions to ensure clarity and future reference.

- **Always over-communicate:** Use group chats or channels to keep everyone informed, as it increases transparency and ensures more visibility.

- **If Stuck Ask questions:** Clearly explain your problem and the steps you've taken to solve it before seeking help.

- **Get to know your teammates:** To establish connection with team members, arrive at meetings five to ten minutes early.

- **Know and understand your teammate:** In order to maintain an effective workflow and prevent needless delays, reply to communications as soon as possible.

- **Put effort and focus on work:** reduce distractions.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I need to improve in the area of communicating with teammates when stuck. My plan is to:
- Thoroughly research and understand the issue before seeking help.
- Continuously seek feedback from seniors.
- Communicate with teammates as quickly as possible instead of wasting too much time attempting to figure out the solution alone.

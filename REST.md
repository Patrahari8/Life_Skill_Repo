# REST and Its Role in Web Architecture

The World Wide Web's architecture was developed using the REST (Representational State Transfer) software architectural style as a reference. REST establishes a set of guidelines for the behavior of the architecture in distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia systems, like the Web. The REST architectural style places a strong emphasis on consistent interfaces, autonomous component deployment, scalable interactions between components, and building a layered architecture that encourages caching to lower perceived latency for users, upholds security, and encapsulates legacy systems.

Across the software industry, REST has been used to build dependable, stateless web applications. **RESTful** is an informal phrase for an application that complies with the REST architectural requirements, while it is most often used to refer to HTTP-based API design.

## REST API Concepts

- **Resource**: In REST, a resource is denoted by a URL. In REST, resources serve as the primary abstraction for data and information.
- **HTTP Methods**: RESTful systems use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources:
  - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
  - `POST`: Create a new resource.
  - `PUT`: Update an existing resource.
  - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.
- **Statelessness**: Every request a client sends to the server needs to include all the details required for the server to comprehend and handle the request. In between requests, the client's state is not stored by the server.
- **Representation**: A variety of formats, including HTML, XML, and JSON, are used to represent resources. Together with certain metadata, the representation includes the resource's data.
- **Uniform Interface**: A consistent interface between components is emphasized by REST. The design is made simpler and more decoupled by the universal interface, allowing for the independent evolution of each component.
- **Cacheability**: By minimizing the number of times the client needs to reconnect to the server, responses that are cacheable must be specified. This improves performance.

## REST vs. SOAP

For apps that need to do CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete), a RESTful approach is preferable. A content management system (CMS) is an excellent illustration, as it creates and updates things using the common HTTP methods `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. REST is also an excellent fit for high-demand applications where specific queries are made often because of its capacity to cache results. Last but not least, REST is widely used, and businesses that employ a RESTful architecture for public APIs can serve a greater spectrum of developers that are familiar with REST.

However, because SOAP-based approaches feature built-in security safeguards, they may be advantageous for systems subject to stringent API security standards and requirements. As an example, it supports strongly-typed contracts and WS-Security.

## Advantages of REST

REST overcomes many of the disadvantages of SOAP, such as the need for clients to know the operation semantics as a pre-requisite for its use, or the use of different ports for different types of notifications. In addition, REST can handle many resources, while SOAP needs many operations to accomplish that.

These are some of the advantages of REST:

- It is usually simple to build and adapt.
- Low use of resources.
- Process instances are created explicitly.
- With the initial URI, the client does not require routing information.
- Clients can have a generic ‘listener’ interface for notifications.

## Conclusion

The simplicity, scalability, and flexibility of RESTful APIs have led to their adoption as the industry standard for web service interfaces. Building reliable and effective APIs requires an understanding of REST and its guiding principles.

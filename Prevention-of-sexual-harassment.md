# Prevention of Sexual Harassment
## Question 1: What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can be caused by various inappropriate behaviors, including:
- Commenting on someoneâ€™s appearance.
- Making sexual jokes in person or within a group.
- Sending sexual messages, images, or emails.
- Giving inappropriate gifts to colleagues.
- Persistently asking someone out.
- Requesting explicit photos.
- Unwanted physical contact.
## Question 2: What would you do if you face or witness any incidents of such behavior?
If I witness or experience sexual harassment, my first step would be to address the issue directly by warning the harasser to stop the inappropriate behavior. If the behavior continues, I would report the incident to my superiors or HR. If the issue is not resolved, I would escalate by filing a formal complaint with the authorities.

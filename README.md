## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
### What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?
The plan to start with very tiny habits, like flossing only one tooth, is the most intriguing one from BJ Fogg's video. This method highlights that consistency and adopting the habit into your daily routine are more important for success than the habit is magnitude or impact. By beginning modestly, you reduce the hurdle of starting, increasing the possibility that you will continue the practice over time.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
### How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
To make new habits easier:
1. **Increase Motivation (M):** Link the habit to something you deeply care about or find enjoyable.
2. **Improve Ability (A):** Simplify the habit to make it easier to do, especially when starting out.
3. **Utilize Prompts (P):** Set clear, consistent cues that trigger the habit, such as pairing it with an existing routine.

- **B = MAP** is a model where Behavior (B) is the result of Motivation (M), Ability (A), and Prompt (P) aligning.
  - **M (Motivation):** Your desire to perform the habit.
  - **A (Ability):** How simple or difficult it is to do the habit.
  - **P (Prompt):** The trigger that reminds you to do the habit.


### Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
Rewarding yourself as soon as you finish a habit helps your brain associate it with the behavior, increasing the likelihood that it will stick. By strengthening your emotional bond with the habit and making you feel good about it, this positive reinforcement enhances the likelihood that you will repeat it. The concept of "Shine" emphasizes that whatever you celebrate becomes a habit, as it associates the action with positive feelings.

### What was the most interesting story or idea for you in this video?
The most intriguing lesson was the idea of constant improvementâ€”becoming 1% better every day. This theory emphasizes that over time, little, steady advancements add up to produce big changes. This is a potent and inspiring method of personal development since the cumulative effect of many small victories can result in significant long-term advancement.


## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits
### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?
According to the book, concentrating on your identity rather than results is the best method to develop habits. Rather than establishing a goal to "read 30 books a year," you become a "reader." It is simpler to develop and maintain habits that represent your ideal self when you concentrate on who you want to become and match your actions with this identity.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
To make a habit easier, the book recommends the following strategies:
1. **Reduce Friction:** Make the habit as convenient as possible. For example, if you want to start exercising, choose a gym close to your home.
2. **Prime Your Environment:** Set up your environment in a way that supports your habit, like placing your workout clothes out the night before.
3. **Use the Two-Minute Rule:** Start by doing a scaled-down version of the habit that takes two minutes or less, which makes it easier to start and build momentum.

### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests:
1. **Increase Friction:** Add steps or make it more inconvenient to perform the habit. For instance, if you want to stop watching TV, unplug it after each use.
2. **Reduce Exposure to Cues:** Remove triggers from your environment. If you want to reduce snacking, keep unhealthy snacks out of the house.
3. **Use Commitment Devices:** Implement systems or tools that prevent you from easily engaging in the habit, like setting parental controls on your devices to limit screen time.

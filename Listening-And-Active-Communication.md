# Listening and Assertive Communication

## 1. Active Listening
### What are the steps or strategies for active listening?
Active listening means fully focusing on and understanding what someone is saying. The steps include:

- Avoid letting your thoughts distract you.
- Don’t interrupt the speaker.
- Use phrases that show you’re listening.
- Show your attentiveness with body language.
- Take notes on key points.
- Repeat back what you’ve heard to ensure clarity.

## 2. Reflective Listening 
### According to Fisher’s model, what are the key points of reflective listening? (Write in your own words, use simple English)
The key points of reflective listening are:

- Understand the message the speaker is trying to convey.
- Repeat the idea back to the speaker to confirm understanding.
- Recognize and acknowledge the speaker’s emotions.
- Respond with empathy, not indifference or fake concern.

## 3. Reflection
### What obstacles do you face in your listening process?
Sometimes, I get distracted by my thoughts and miss parts of the conversation. I also don’t use open-ended phrases often and rarely make eye contact while listening.

### How can you improve your listening skills?
I can improve by showing more interest in the conversation and connecting with the speaker. Reflective listening can help me stay engaged, and I need to remind myself to maintain eye contact.

## 4. Types of Communication
### When do you switch to a passive communication style in your daily life?
I tend to switch to a passive communication style when someone, usually an elder, tries to push me into doing something I don’t want to do.

### When do you switch to an aggressive communication style in your daily life?
I usually stay calm, but sometimes I switch to an aggressive style when someone younger speaks rudely or tries to insult me.

### When do you switch to a passive-aggressive communication style (like sarcasm, gossip, taunts, or silent treatment) in your daily life?
I switch to a passive-aggressive style when someone makes a silly mistake or doesn’t follow instructions.

### How can you make your communication assertive?
I can work on expressing my feelings more clearly and understanding my needs. It’s also important to know my limits and communicate them to others. Using appropriate body language will also help.
